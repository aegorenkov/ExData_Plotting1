# Loading the data

## We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.

## You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to
## Date/Time classes in R using the `strptime()` and `as.Date()`
## functions.

## Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as `?`.


# Making the plot

## Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
## pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

### Plot description

## Title "Global Active Power"
## y-axis label: "Frequency", range: 0-1200
## x-axis label: "Global Active Power (kilowatts)", range: 0-6

## Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

## Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository
